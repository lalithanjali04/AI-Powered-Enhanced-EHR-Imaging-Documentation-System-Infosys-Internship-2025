Sprint,Day,Impediments,Action Taken
Sprint 1,Day 2,Image enhancement model output blurry for low-light radiology images,Added preprocessing (contrast normalization + histogram equalization)
Sprint 1,Day 4,Backend API returning slow responses during image enhancement inference,Enabled model warm‑loading and optimized CUDA batch size
Sprint 2,Day 3,Clinical summary generation occasionally missing key symptoms from clinician notes,Improved text preprocessing and added medical keyword extraction
Sprint 2,Day 5,ICD‑10 code prediction giving low‑confidence outputs for multi‑disease cases,Added confidence thresholding and fallback multi‑label classification rule
Sprint 3,Day 2,Frontend UI failing to display enhanced images due to incorrect base64 formatting,Fixed decoder handling and updated API response structure
Sprint 3,Day 4,Users reporting long wait time when summary + ICD‑10 tasks run together,Separated tasks into async workers using queue-based processing
Sprint 4,Day 1,Deployment build failing because of incompatible Python dependency versions,Pinned stable versions and rebuilt using isolated virtual environment
Sprint 4,Day 3,Doctors unable to upload large DICOM files on UI,Increased upload size limit and implemented progressive uploading
